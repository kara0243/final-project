## Pawsitive Futures

### Process
I started by thinking about the best Bootstrap components to use for each part of my project. I then added my custom colors to the root and applied font styles to the body.

1. **Homepage**:
   - I began with the navigation bar, coding it once and adding it to all pages.
   - Then created a banner with a responsive hero image and positioned text and a button on top.
   - I used cards for two sections, organizing them with rows and columns for responsiveness on different screen sizes.
   - Also coded the footer and added it on all pages.

2. **Adoption Page**:
   - Designed a banner without an image.
   - Added cards for dogs and cats, using unique IDs for each section to link the buttons to specific areas of the page.

3. **Contact Page**:
   - Created a contact form and included a location section.
   - Added a large logo that links back to the homepage.

The entire process was straightforward but time-consuming, especially when learning how to select the best class for each part and function. I noticed that changing styles in CSS is sometimes easier than editing classes in Bootstrap, as changes often need to be applied to multiple elements.


### Challenges

1. **Adding Custom Colors**:
   - **Challenge**: My custom colors needed to be in RGB format which you helped me with, which I initially found confusing.

2. **Navigation Dropdown Menu**:
   - **Challenge**: The "Adoption" link needed to work as a page link without triggering the dropdown menu so I added CSS so the dropdown to open on hover instead of click.

3. **Hero Image Text Positioning**:
   - **Challenge**: Finding the ideal position for the text over the hero image so I a djusted the positioning so many times until it aligned perfectly with the design.

4. **Aligning Items in Cards**:
   - **Challenge**: Aligning items within cards was particularly tricky I tried with different alignment utilities and padding/margin, flex, align-self  and adjustments until finfding the best layout.
